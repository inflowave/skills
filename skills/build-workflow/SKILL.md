description: Build a new Inflowave automation workflow from a plain-English goal — pick the right trigger, actions, and wiring, create it as a draft that's valid by construction, then run a safe simulated test before the user activates it. Use when the user says "build a workflow", "create an automation", "set up a nurture sequence", "when X happens do Y", or describes an automation they want.

# Build Workflow

Turn "when a new lead comes in, tag them and send a welcome DM after an hour" into
a working, tested draft — without the user touching the builder.

## Steps

1. **Scope + workspace.** `check_connection`; `list_sub_accounts` and confirm
   WHICH workspace this workflow belongs to (never assume). If it should target
   specific clients, `list_clients` and confirm.

2. **Nail the trigger.** Map the user's "when" to a real trigger with
   `list_trigger_types`, then `describe_trigger` for its exact config shape.
   Common ones: `contact_created`, `form_submitted`, `tag_added`,
   `appointment_booked`, `instagram_message`, `stripe_payment_received`,
   `custom_object_record_created`. Confirm any config (keywords, form id, object type).

3. **Design the steps.** Map each "do this" to an action with `list_action_types`;
   for message/email/SMS/DM copy, use only **namespaced** template variables
   (`{lead.first_name}`, `{lead.email}`, `{agency.name}`) — call
   `list_template_variables` and never use a bare `{first_name}` (the engine
   rejects it). Insert delays/conditions where the flow needs them.

4. **Assemble the envelope and create.** Call `create_workflow` with:
   - `sub_account_id` (the confirmed workspace)
   - `name`, `trigger`, `nodes` (each `step_type` + typed `config`), `edges`.
   - The trigger node is auto-injected as `trigger_1` — wire your first node's
     incoming edge from `source_node_id: "trigger_1"`; do not include the trigger
     in `nodes`.
   - The first call returns a **confirmation envelope** echoing the resolved
     workspace/clients — relay it, confirm, then re-call with `confirm: true`.
   - It's created as a **draft** (`is_active: false`). Good — never auto-activate.

5. **Test before activation.** Run `test_workflow` — it simulates the run
   (messages are NOT sent to real people, waits are skipped) and returns a
   per-node trace. Walk the user through what would happen. Only activate if they
   explicitly ask.

## Output

- A plain-English description of the workflow you built (trigger → steps).
- The draft id.
- The test-run trace, summarized ("a new lead would be tagged, then DM'd after 1h
  with: …").
- "Ready to turn it on? Say the word and I'll activate it."

## Guardrails
- Valid by construction: use `describe_trigger` / `list_action_types` /
  `list_template_variables` so configs and variables are correct on the first try.
- Never activate without an explicit request.
- Confirm the workspace and any client scope before creating.
- If the goal needs a disconnected integration (IG, a domain, a payment
  provider), flag it — the workflow will build but won't fire until connected.

## Node + edge shape (get this right or `create_workflow` 422s)

The MCP validator is STRICTER than the loose examples in `get_workflow_schema`.
Build every node and edge in exactly this shape:

- **Node**: `{ "id", "name", "step_type", "config": { "action_type", ...fields } }`.
  - The action verb goes ONLY inside `config.action_type` — a top-level
    `action_type` is rejected ("extra_forbidden").
  - Do NOT send `position` — it is rejected too (the builder lays nodes out).
  - `step_type` is one of `action | condition | delay | wait_for_response |
    router | switch | split | merge | end` (see `get_workflow_schema` steps).
- **Edge**: `{ "id", "source_node_id", "target_node_id", "condition_label"? }`.
  - Do NOT send `condition_value` — rejected. Branch ONLY on `condition_label`.
  - For a boolean `condition` node, the two edges MUST read as true/false:
    use `condition_label` `"true"` and `"false"` (synonyms `yes/no`, `1/0`,
    `t/f` also work). A condition with only one branch FAILS CLOSED — the path
    just ends, it does not fall through.
  - For a `wait_for_response` node, label the edges `"responded"` and
    `"timeout"`.
- **Trigger**: pass it as the top-level `trigger` arg (NOT in `nodes`). It is
  auto-injected as node id `trigger_1`; wire your first node's incoming edge from
  `source_node_id: "trigger_1"`.

Validate before handing off: `validate_workflow_config(workflow_id, ...)` returns
`is_valid` + `can_activate` and is the source of truth. Note that `test_workflow`
reports `skipped` for a keyword-filtered comment/DM trigger — the harness's
synthetic event doesn't contain the keyword, so the trigger correctly doesn't
fire. That is NOT a broken workflow; confirm with `validate_workflow_config`.

## Comment-to-DM playbook (Instagram)

The single most-requested automation. Build it like this:

1. **Trigger** = `comment_posted` (frontend alias `post_or_reel_comment`).
   Config: `keywords` (list), `keyword_match: "any"`, optionally `post_id` /
   `specific_posts` to limit to one post, `include_replies` to also fire on
   reply-comments. Runtime context you can use in copy: `{trigger.comment_text}`,
   `{trigger.comment_id}`, `{trigger.commenter_id}`, `{trigger.post_id}`.
2. **First DM = a private reply, automatically.** Use a normal `send_dm` node.
   For a commenter who never messaged first, Instagram forbids a cold DM — the
   engine detects the cold-comment open and sends that first message as an IG
   **private reply to the comment** (allowed once per comment, 7-day window). You
   do NOT need a special action; just `send_dm` off a comment trigger.
3. **Buttons that you can branch on must be `postback`**:
   `"buttons": [{ "type": "postback", "title": "...", "payload": "..." }]`. The
   `clicked_button` condition matches on that `payload`. A `type: "url"` button is
   UNTRACKABLE (Meta sends no webhook on tap) — to gate on a link click, use a
   tracked link + a `wait_for_link_click`, never `clicked_button`.
4. **Point-in-time conditions need a wait in front of them.** `clicked_button`,
   `message_seen`, `follows_account` and `lead_has_responded` evaluate instantly,
   so a condition placed right after a send always takes the NO branch (the human
   hasn't acted in that split second). Put a `wait_for_response` (resolves the
   instant they tap/reply) or a `delay` BEFORE the condition.
5. **Public reply vs DM**: `reply_comment` posts a public reply (requires
   `message_template`); `send_dm` opens the private thread. A great combo does
   both — public acknowledgement, then the resource in the DM.
6. **AI replies**: `ai_response` (config `ai_instructions`, optional
   `message_content: "{trigger.comment_text}"`) produces `ai_message`; feed it
   into a `reply_comment` or `send_dm` via `{workflow.<ai_node_id>.ai_message}`.

### Advanced gates — what's real vs best-effort
- **Follower-count gate** (e.g. VIP > 1000): reliable. Add a `fetch_profile_info`
  action first to populate the profile, then a `follower_count_greater_than`
  condition (`operand: 1000`). VIP branch → `send_voice_note`, standard branch →
  `send_dm`.
- **Voice note**: `send_voice_note` accepts `text` alone (the account's default
  voice is used); for the customer's own cloned voice add `voice_clone_id` from
  `list_voice_clones`. Tell them to record a clone for the personal touch.
- **Follows-us check**: `follows_account` reads a profile flag that is only
  populated AFTER `fetch_profile_info` (or an inbound profile webhook) has run —
  put it behind a wait. Pairing it with a "Do you follow us?" `postback` buttons
  ask gives a good UX and a reliable signal.
- **Country / region filter**: `from_country` + operator `in_list` / `not_in_list`
  + a list operand EXISTS, but Instagram does not expose a commenter's country,
  so `{lead.country}` is usually EMPTY for a fresh commenter. Design the branch so
  an UNKNOWN country PROCEEDS (don't hard-block on empty), and tell the customer
  it only filters leads whose country was enriched by other means. Don't oversell
  it as reliable geo-blocking.
- **Collect email**: there is no dedicated capture action. Pattern: `send_dm`
  asking for the email → `wait_for_response` → `has_email` condition (or persist
  with `update_lead`, `data: { "email": "{workflow.<wait_node>.response.response_content}" }`),
  then `add_tag` to mark them captured.
- **Tag responders** at each meaningful step with `add_tag`
  (`tag_names: ["..."]`) so the customer can segment and retarget.

## If / else and heavy branching — the exact procedure

This is where builds most often go wrong. Follow it literally.

1. **A branch is a `condition` node.** Its `config` needs `condition_type` and,
   for comparisons, `operand`. List the type with `list_condition_types` and
   confirm the exact operand with `describe_condition`. Common: `has_email`,
   `has_tag`/`tag_exists` (operand = tag name), `follows_account`,
   `follower_count_greater_than`/`_less_than` (operand = number),
   `reply_contains_keyword` (operand = word), `clicked_button`,
   `lead_has_responded`, `message_seen`, `from_country`.
2. **Every condition node needs BOTH a true and a false edge.** Wire two edges
   out of it with `condition_label: "true"` and `condition_label: "false"`
   (synonyms `yes`/`no` work). A condition with only one branch FAILS CLOSED — if
   the missing side is taken, the run just ends silently. This is the #1 "nothing
   happened" cause. Both sides must go somewhere (a step, or an `end` node).
3. **Point-in-time conditions must sit behind a wait.** `clicked_button`,
   `message_seen`, `follows_account`, `lead_has_responded` are evaluated the
   instant the run reaches them. Placed right after a send, they ALWAYS take the
   NO branch (the human hasn't acted in that split second). Put a
   `wait_for_response` (resolves the moment they reply/tap) or a `delay` BEFORE
   the condition, then branch.
4. **Nested if/else** = chain condition nodes: the true (or false) edge of the
   first condition points at the second condition, each with its own two edges.
   Don't try to express "A and B" in one node unless the condition type supports
   grouped conditions — prefer two chained nodes, it's clearer on canvas.
5. **Multi-way (more than 2 outcomes)** = a `switch`/`router` step keyed on a
   variable, or several chained conditions. Confirm with `get_node_schema`.

## Recipe: "check if they follow us" (do it this way)

There is no one-click "did they follow" trigger. Two reliable patterns — use the
button one for a fresh commenter, the profile one when the follow state is known:

- **Ask + verify (best for cold comment/DM):**
  1. `send_dm` asking "Are you following us?" with two `postback` buttons
     (`button_type: "postback"`, e.g. label "Yes, I follow" / "Not yet", each with
     a distinct `payload`).
  2. `wait_for_response` (resolves on their tap; set `timeout_hours`).
  3. `condition` `follows_account` (server-side truth) → true = continue,
     false = a nudge DM ("give us a follow and I'll unlock it") then `end`.
  Using BOTH the button and `follows_account` means a lie ("Yes" without
  following) is caught by the real check.
- **Profile-based (when you'll enrich first):** run `fetch_profile_info` (populates
  the follow flag + follower count), then a `wait`/`delay`, then the
  `follows_account` condition. Without the enrich step the flag is empty and the
  condition takes the NO branch — always enrich or ask first.

Tell the customer plainly: the follow check is reliable once the profile is
fetched or they've tapped a button; it is not instant on a brand-new commenter.
